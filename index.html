  <h1>My favorite charecter is Luna lovegood from harry potter.She is clever ,kind and always is loyal to whom she thinks is right.Many people insult her but she does not care.when she was stuck in prison with mr Olivander , she looks after the frail and weak old man.She fought bravely in the final battel of hogwarts and helped the hogwarts students win the fight.She was loved by Harry and he named his duaghter Lily Luna Potter after her.She did not have many friends and when she was 9 years old she lost her mother.She was happy to have Harry Potter,Hemione Granger ,Ron Weasly ,Ginny Weasly and Neville Longbottem as her only friends.she decorated her bedroom with pictures of them .She was always there to lend a helping hand to anyone who needed it.</h1>  
    <h3>One of her most famous quotes was-"Don't worry ,your just as sane as I as I am</h3>
    <h3>some more of Luna lovegoods quotes-
    .Things we lose always have  a way to come back to us.
    .Being different is not a bad thing,it means your brave enough to be yourself.</h3>
